estimation-checklist
====================

Here we are trying to enumerate our objectives to get a better understanding of the size of work before estimating. This should include all the parts we forget such as project setup, installation etc.


User Requirements
-----------------

A bulleted list of requirements. A requirement must be one thing.

User stories may be included to generate the list:

	"As a manager user, I need to add new users to the system"

However keep them to one action per line:

	DON'T USE: "As a manager user, I need to add new users to the system and set their permissions"


Project Objectives 
------------------

A bulleted list of actions you must complete. This will become your backlog. When every item is completed, you are finished.

This will become your backlog. When you identify a new action, add it to the objectives list



External Dependencies
---------------------

For each objective: 

What will I break?

What might I break?



Unit Testing
------------

For each item, how do I test it achieves the objective?



Regression Testing
------------------

What will need regression testing I have not broken anything?



Setup
-----

I will need to install?



Interface Documentation
-----------------------

I will need to document what files and for who?


Delivery
--------

List the items which will presented for delivery

Now, for each item, how will I prepare it for delivery?  (minification, compilation etc)?

Feed those results back into your objectives list.
